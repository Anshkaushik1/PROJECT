The accuracy of the model is evaluated, and a classification report provides additional insights into the model's performance. This analysis can help in understanding the potential impact of news sentiment on financial markets."],"metadata":{"id":"6YDHj1wAmdx9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"GbICFMLOrFMB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
